                        <p>ABOUT PROJECT<br><br>HTTP://OFPLACE.INFO/ is the result of an extensive surveillance collection of Google Maps satellite images. With choices dictated by randomization, pre-established rules, curiosity, and intuition, ://OFPLACE. archives 600 images of 20 different cities. ://OFPLACE. simultaneously compares and contrasts both basic and strange infrastructural features of various cities while it also allows the user to explore cities around the world in a way thatâ€™s dictated by intuition rather than preconceived notions tied to a specific location.<br><br>HAVING TROUBLE NAVIGATING?<br><br>Hover over images to see a more detailed view. Click on whichever image you are most visually compelled by. Once selected, you will have the option to explore the city from which your selected image was taken or to see images of the same category yet varying locations. Once deciding between the two written options, ten new images will be revealed for you to repeat the process. Upon exploring this for ten rounds, you will have the chance to review your digital journey and receive a generated printable or digital asset<br>(coming soon).</p>
